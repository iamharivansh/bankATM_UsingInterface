bankATM_UsingInterface – Project Description 

bankATM_UsingInterface is a Java-based console application that demonstrates core OOP concepts using interfaces. The project simulates ATM operations for different banks and locations by defining common ATM functionalities through interfaces and implementing them in multiple classes.

It includes features such as PIN generation, balance enquiry, cash withdrawal, and withdrawal limits, with separate implementations for banks like HDFC and SBI and ATM locations such as Powai, Thane, and Bhandup.
This design ensures loose coupling, code reusability, scalability, and clean architecture, reflecting real-world banking system behavior.

Key Concepts Used:

Interface & multiple inheritance

Abstraction & polymorphism

Modular and maintainable design

Real-world ATM use case simulation
